# Linux-Benchmark
Linux benchmark scripts (Bash, JS, HTML5)

You'll find individual tests from parameters such as memory to an overall benchmark score.
Download and install a copy of the Geekbench-4, Geekbench-3, Intel Benchmark, and sysbench.
Run the script, which benchmarks your CPU, GPU, memory bandwidth, and file system performance. 
At the end the script will export data to remote Apache server (database folder).
